# Tinyraytracer

This is my implementation of a tiny raytracer in various languages, following several courses ([tinyraytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki) and [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html))

## Implementations

+ Racket: **discontinued** as I am not writing good functional code
+ Golang: **ongoing**
